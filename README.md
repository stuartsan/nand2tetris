Course assignments and materials from The Elements of Computing Systems, aka [nand2tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/).

The main dish of the course is a two-stage compiler that spans projects 7-8 (backend, translates VM to assembly) and projects 10-11 (frontend, translates Jack, a simplified Java-like high level language, into VM code).

For info on running the tests, _extensive_ info is available at [nand2tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/). To run the compiler, see the inline documentation within projects/07/vmtranslator.js for the frontend and projects/11/compiler/compiler.js for the backend.
